Functional Requirements:  A looping, menu-driven program that allows the user to create a binary tree and to display data about the tree.

Programming Requirements:

Using the IntBinaryTree class from Chapter 21 as the starting point, add the following member functions:  

Leaf Counter (which counts and returns the number of leaf nodes in the tree)

Tree Height (which counts and returns the height of the tree - the height is the number of levels it contains. 

Tree Width (which counts and returns the width of the tree - the width is the largest number of nodes in the same level.)

Write a menu-driven program that will allow the user to:

1.  Insert numbers

2.  Display the tree (in order)

3.  Display Leaf Count

4.  Display Tree Height

5.  Display Tree Width

6.  Exit


Your program should contain high-level validation for numeric input (use a while loop and allow use to re-enter the data).  

----------------

Test your program as follows:

Insert the following numbers (one at a time through menu option 1):  10, 87, 9, 55, 13, 40, 22,1,0,77, 0, 4, 55, 33, 22

Display the tree

Display the leaf count

Display the tree height

Display the tree width

--------------

Submit the following:

1.  all the C++ files

2.  one jing that shows the program running properly.  And one jing that shows error handling.
